            <h1>Weather Extremes</h1>
            <p>Weather extremes can have adverse effects on human health, including concerns from severe heat and cold. Storms and harsh conditions, such as hurricanes and droughts, can create secondary dangers, including floods and wildfires.</p>
            <p>NIEHS has resources on many types of events and conditions, and some are included on this webpage.</p>
            <h2>Temperature Extremes</h2>
            <h2>Heat</h2>
            <p>As a result of the changing climate, heat waves are happening more often. An increased number of extreme heat days or prolonged exposure to hot temperatures can harm your health. Extreme heat is a threat to human health worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.A heat wave's effects on human health can be difficult to track, but researchers are making progress. A NIEHS-funded study found that a period of unprecedented and dangerously high temperatures was associated with additional injury deaths in Washington state.Heat-related illnesses include heat exhaustion, heat cramps, and heat stroke (also called sun stroke). Heat stroke, considered a medical emergency, occurs when a body's regulatory system fails to cool itself. As your body works to cool itself, blood rushes to the surface of your skin. As a result, less blood reaches your brain, muscles, and other organs, which can, in rare cases, cause brain damage or death.</p>
