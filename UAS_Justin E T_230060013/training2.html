                <p>A new study shows that human instruction is still necessary to detect and compensate for unintended, and sometimes negative, changes in neurosurgeon behavior after virtual reality AI training. This finding has implications for other fields of training.</p>
                <p>In the study, 46 medical students performed a tumour removal procedure on a virtual reality simulator.</p>
                <p>Half of them were randomly selected to receive instruction from an AI-powered intelligent tutor called the Virtual Operative Assistant (VOA), which uses a machine learning algorithm to teach surgical techniques and provide personalized feedback.</p>
                <p>The other half served as a control group by receiving no feedback.</p>
                <p>The students' work was then compared to performance benchmarks selected by a team of established neurosurgeons.</p>
                <p>Comparing the results, AI-tutored students caused 55 per cent less damage to healthy tissues than the control group.</p>
