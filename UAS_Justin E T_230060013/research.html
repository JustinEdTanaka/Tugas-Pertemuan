                    <h3>Can tattoos cause blood or skin cancer?</h3>
                    <p>Some research has found a link between tattoos and an increased risk of cancer, and recent evidence appears to suggest that tattoos could heighten the risk of blood cancer, in particular. What biological mechanisms might explain this link, and should people really worry about the health implications of getting a tattoo?</p>

                    <h3>Assessing unintended consequences in AI-based neurosurgical training</h3>
                    <p>A new study shows that human instruction is still necessary to detect and compensate for unintended, and sometimes negative, changes in neurosurgeon behavior after virtual reality AI training. This finding has implications for other fields of training.</p>

                    <p>They published their results in the Journal of Surgical Education. The researchers hold patents on the technology used in this work. In addition to working to improve the central line placement training, the team is also applying the framework to other common procedures with high complication rates, such as colonoscopies and laparoscopic surgeries.</p>
