                <p>For this study, researchers analyzed data from more than 32,000 adults with an average age of 45 who received a CT scan between January 2012 and December 2015.</p>
                <p>“A CT scan is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of the inside of your body,” Seungho Ryu, MD, PhD, (he/him) professor of medicine at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital at Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea and senior author of this study explained to Medical News Today.</p>
                <p>“It takes many pictures from different angles, which are then combined to create cross-sectional images, like slices of bread, of the inside of your body. This allows doctors to see your bones, muscles, organs, and fat in much greater detail.”</p>
                <p>“These detailed images can help identify the risk of type 2 diabetes by showing key indicators such as visceral fat (fat around internal organs), subcutaneous fat (fat under the skin), muscle mass and quality, liver fat, and aortic calcificationTrusted Source (calcium build-up in the large arteries),” Ryu continued.</p>
