                <h1>Breaking News: New treatment may stop and potentially reverse some nerve damage in MS</h1>

                <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks and destroys the myelin sheathTrusted Source of nerve cells. It most commonly strikes people between the ages of 20 and 40. Some studies estimate that the prevalence of MS in the U.S. is close to 1 million.</p>
                <p>When immune cells attack the myelin sheath, this causes inflammation and interrupts the passage of nerve impulses around the body, leading to neurological symptoms which may include:</p>
                <p>-Muscle weakness </p>
                <p>-Numbness, tingling and pain</p>  
                <P>-Bowel and bladder problems</P>   
                <p>-Fatigue</p>   
                <p>-Dizziness and vertigo</p>
                <p>-Mobility problems</p>
                <p>-Vision loss.</p>
                <p>Although there is no cure, current treatments can slow the progression of the disease, reduce the number and severity of relapses, and relieve symptoms.</p>
                <p>Now, researchers have developed a treatment that can help regenerate myelin around nerve cells, potentially reversing the damage caused by MS.</p>
