            <h1>NIH's Strategic Response</h1>
            <p>NIH's response plan includes five strategic priorities to guide COVID-19 programs and research</p>
            <p>In late 2019, NIH worked quickly to create and act on a plan to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We prioritized research to study SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and developed tests, treatments, and vaccines to detect, treat, and prevent the disease, including support for communities that were hardest hit by the pandemic.Below, you can explore our research priorities and related initiatives, stories, and topics. For more detailed information, read the complete NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.Improve our knowledge about the disease</li>
                <li>2.Develop diagnostic tests</li>
                <li>3.Discover and develop treatments</li>
                <li>4.Develop vaccines to improve protection and prevention</li>
                <li>5.Understand the risk to and provide support for people at higher risk of infection</li>
            </ul>
